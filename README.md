I crafted a Python-based Caesar cipher project that not only encrypts messages but also decrypts them. Users input a message and a shift value for encryption or decryption. The program seamlessly encrypts by shifting each letter in the alphabet by the specified amount while preserving case and leaving non-alphabetic characters unaltered. Additionally, the project includes a decryption feature, enabling the reversal of the encryption process. This comprehensive functionality serves as an interactive and educational tool, offering hands-on experience in both encrypting and decrypting messages using the classic Caesar cipher technique.
